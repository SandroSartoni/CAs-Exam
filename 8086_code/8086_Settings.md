8086 Settings
=============================================

In order to have these files running in emu8086, after having installed the emulator, simply load
the file and click on emulate. Many windows will open, giving the possibility to debug the file.
No further actions are required. 
To get this file running with MASM:
  * Download MASM and DOSBox at the link: https://mega.nz/#!4exx2KZI!gnlI4rPvYBhElE-y_k-p9GtBfw550U82ZFB-lHqZJho .
  * Install DOSBox and move the directory, in the rar file, named "8086" in C: folder, i.e. to have C:\8086. Copy in 8086
    folder the assembly files we want to compile and run.
  * Once in DOSBox, type first " mount c: c:\8086", then "c: ", next "ml filename.asm" and finally "filename.exe".
